The app features user identification, where each message is displayed with the sender's name for clarity. The user interface is responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across devices, and messages are shown in styled, color-coded bubbles for better readability. The backend leverages Django for handling WebSocket connections and managing real-time interactions, while the frontend uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for a polished look.
